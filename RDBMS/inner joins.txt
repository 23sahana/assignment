Assignment 4: Craft a query using an INNER JOIN to combine 'orders' and 'customers' 
tables for customers in a specified region, and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders
SELECT *
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.region = 'specified_region';
We're selecting all columns from the 'customers' table.
We're using LEFT JOIN to ensure that all customers are included in the result set, even if they don't have orders.
We're specifying the condition for the join using 'customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id'.
We're filtering the result set based on the specified region using the WHERE clause. You can replace 'specified_region' with the actual region you want to query for.
