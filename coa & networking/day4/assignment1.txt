project plan for a new software feature using Agile
planning techniques. Include backlog items with estimated story points and a prioritized list of user stories.

Here are some example backlog items along with their estimated story points:

**User Stories:**
1. **As a patient, I want to be able to schedule a doctor appointment online:** (5 story points)
2. **As a patient, I want to see the available time slots for a specific doctor:** (3 story points)
3. **As a patient, I want to receive confirmation of my appointment via email:** (2 story points)
4. **As a patient, I want to be able to cancel or reschedule my appointment:** (5 story points)
5. **As a doctor, I want to view my upcoming appointments:** (3 story points)
6. **As a doctor, I want to be notified when a patient schedules, cancels, or reschedules an appointment:** (5 story points)
7. **As an admin, I want to add new doctors and their availability:** (8 story points)
8. **As an admin, I want to manage patient records securely:** (8 story points)

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
1. **Ensure HIPAA compliance for patient data:** (5 story points)
2. **Implement secure login and authentication:** (3 story points)
3. **Design a user-friendly interface:** (5 story points)

**2. Prioritized List of User Stories:**

The prioritized list of user stories might look like this:

1. **As a patient, I want to be able to schedule a doctor appointment online:** 
This is the core functionality of the system and should be prioritized first.
2. **As an admin, I want to add new doctors and their availability:** Without doctors available,
 patients won't be able to schedule appointments.
3. **As a patient, I want to be able to cancel or reschedule my appointment:** Providing flexibility to patients is crucial.
4. **As a doctor, I want to be notified when a patient schedules, cancels, or reschedules an appointment:
 This is important for managing the doctor's schedule efficiently.
5. **As a patient, I want to see the available time slots for a specific doctor:** 
This enhances the user experience by providing relevant information upfront.
6. **As a doctor, I want to view my upcoming appointments:** Essential for doctors to plan their day.
7. **As a patient, I want to receive confirmation of my appointment via email:** Provides reassurance and serves as a reminder.
8. **As an admin, I want to manage patient records securely:** While important, this can be implemented once the core functionalities are in place.

**3. Agile Approach:**

Utilizing Scrum or Kanban methodologies, the team can break down these user stories into smaller tasks and track progress through sprints or continuous flow. Daily
 stand-ups can help address any blockers or issues. Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives will allow for continuous improvement of the process and the product.
