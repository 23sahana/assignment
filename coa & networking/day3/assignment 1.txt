Benefits of TDD
Bug Reduction
Writing tests before code helps catch bugs early in the development process.
Reduces the number of bugs in the codebase.
Software Reliability
TDD ensures that the code is reliable and works as expected.
Gives developers confidence in the code they write.
Improved Code Quality
TDD promotes writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
Encourages developers to think about the design and architecture of the code.
Faster Development
TDD helps developers write code faster because they know exactly what they need to implement.
Reduces the time spent on debugging and fixing bugs.

Better Design
TDD promotes good design principles, such as loose coupling and high cohesion.
Encourages developers to think about the interfaces and APIs of the code.
Reduced Fear of Change
TDD gives developers the confidence to make changes to the code without fear of breaking it.
Encourages developers to refactor and improve the codebase over time.
By following the TDD process, developers can write high-quality code that is reliable, 
maintainable, and efficient. TDD helps reduce bugs, improves code quality, and promotes good design principles,
 making it an essential practice for any software development team.
